# DILL.FINANCE

Meet Dill, the DeFi Protocol for staking and earning rewards

Dill is an open source DEFI project focused on sustainable yield. it is a deflationary token, On every transaction, 5% of the tokens in the transaction are burned permanently and the other 5% is distributed towards stakers.
This is done to increase the value of each DILL token over time. The more tokens you stake, the more fees you will earn, this is the reason why there is no fixed APY.
